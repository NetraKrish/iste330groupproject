1. Make sure you have the objects package along with the iste330Group4DataLayer.java file.

2. Setup our database on localhost.
   DATABASE FILE: iste330group4.sql

3. For datalayer test, run the main method inside iste330Group4DataLayer.java

* IF YOU RUN MULTIPLE TIMES, COMMENT OUT THE METHODS THAT "ADD" ITEMS OR YOU WILL GET DUPLICATES!

* Feel free to mess around with some of the tester functions, and even add more tests for functions not implemented.
* FYI, only implement the PUBLIC functions in the tests, if they are PRIVATE, they're helper functions.
